              <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
                Scientists face significant challenges when analyzing complex
                antibody structures and their properties. Traditional methods
                rely heavily on physical lab tests, which are time-consuming,
                expensive, and often require multiple iterations to validate
                findings. Visualizing molecular structures and understanding
                their behavior at a detailed level can be cumbersome without an
                efficient digital tool.

                  <strong>Requirement Analysis and API Integration:</strong> We
                  started by understanding the core requirements: fetching
                  antibody data, rendering a table, integrating a 3D protein
                  viewer, and applying dynamic coloring. API endpoints were
                  defined for various purposes like fetching antibody data, PDB
                  files, and residue-wise properties.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Frontend Design:</strong> The first step in the
                  frontend workflow was to create the table displaying the
                  antibody data, with color-coded scores and &quot;View Structure&quot;
                  buttons.

                <li>
                  <strong>Integrating Mol* Viewer:</strong> The Mol* viewer was
                  integrated into the right panel for rendering the 3D structure
                  when the user clicked the button.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Dynamic Property Coloring:</strong> Property data was
                  fetched and used to apply dynamic coloring to the protein
                  structure based on charge, hydrophobicity, and polarity.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>User Interaction Flow:</strong> The flow was designed
                  to fetch antibody data, display it in a table, and allow users
                  to view the 3D structure with dynamic coloring.

                Developing an intuitive and fully functional app using Molstar

              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
                <li>
                  <strong>Molstar Implementation:</strong> Understanding the
                  integration of Molstar into our application was a complex task
                  due to the lack of comprehensive examples and its advanced
                  functionality.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Rendering the Structure:</strong> Rendering 3D
                  structures dynamically and ensuring smooth transitions in the
                  UI required significant effort to optimize performance and
                  maintain accuracy.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Changing Properties and Polymer Views:</strong>{" "}
                  Identifying how to modify molecular properties and switch
                  between polymer views programmatically was challenging due to
                  the intricate and less-documented API.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Dynamic UI Updates:</strong> Implementing real-time
                  adjustments to polymers and properties while reflecting these
                  changes in the user interface demanded careful design and
                  testing.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Placement of Range Labels:</strong> Deciding where and
                  how to display range labels for clarity without overcrowding
                  the UI required iterative design improvements.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>UI Errors:</strong> Handling UI issues, such as
                  ensuring compatibility with dark mode and addressing
                  browser-specific errors, added complexity to the development
                  process.

              I made several dynamic and structural improvements to enhance the
              user interface. The dynamic polymer change feature was
              implemented, allowing for real-time polymer modifications in the
              UI. I also introduced dynamic property changes, enabling users to
              adjust properties interactively. The Hero section of the UI
              underwent changes to improve its design, making it more visually
              appealing and responsive across different devices. Additionally, I
              added Ranges Labels to provide better clarity and understanding of
              data ranges, improving user interaction.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also addressed key performance issues in the project. I fixed
              the re-render issue of the Mol component, ensuring smoother and
              more stable performance of the 3D structure viewer. Furthermore, I
              resolved the issue of overlapping 3D structures and polymers,
              which resulted in a cleaner, more organized visual layout. These
              changes significantly improved the user experience, making the
              interface more intuitive and stable for users interacting with
              molecular visualizations.

              I fetched the CSV file and successfully rendered the table to
              display the data dynamically. I integrated the Mol* component and
              loaded the respective PDB files for each row, allowing users to
              interact with molecular structures directly from the table. This
              integration enabled a seamless experience for users to visualize
              data and structures corresponding to each entry. Additionally, I
              enhanced the Header and Table page UI, improving the overall
              design, responsiveness, and user experience. The table layout was
              optimized to ensure smooth navigation and interaction with the
              data presented.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also implemented Properties Ranges as labels for each property,
              providing users with clear indicators of the range for each item,
              which helped in better understanding the data. Furthermore, I
              proposed the idea of adding a brief description of the project and
              creating a separate dashboard for this information. This would
              give users a centralized space to access relevant project details,
              improving the clarity and organization of the application. These
              enhancements contributed to a more user-friendly and informative
              interface, improving both the functionality and the aesthetic of
              the project.

              I developed the UI design, focusing on creating a cohesive and
              user-friendly interface. This included designing the header and
              footer to ensure consistent navigation and accessibility
              throughout the website. The landing pages were also created with a
              clean layout and engaging visuals to enhance the user&apos;s first
              impression and experience. Additionally, I made card components
              that present content in a modular and organized manner, making the
              UI visually appealing and easy to navigate. These cards were
              designed to be responsive and adaptable across different screen
              sizes, improving overall usability.
            </p>
            <p>
              Furthermore, I implemented Properties Ranges as labels for each
              property, providing clear and intuitive indicators of the value
              ranges for each property. This feature helps users quickly
              understand the scope of data and easily interact with the
              interface. The addition of these property labels improved the
              overall clarity of the data presentation, making it more
              accessible and easier for users to interpret the values. Together,
              these design and functionality improvements contributed to a more
              polished and user-centric interface, ensuring that both the layout
              and interactive elements were optimized for an engaging user
              experience.
